=head2 Other Perl modules on CPAN

=head3 Image::ExifTool

L<Image::ExifTool> is a pure Perl (doesn't require a C compiler)
solution for accessing the text segments of images. It has extensive
support for PNG text segments.

=head3 Alien::PNG

L<Alien::PNG> claims to be a way of "building, finding and using PNG
binaries". It may help in installing libpng. I didn't use it as a
dependency for this module because it seems not to work in batch mode,
but stop and prompt the user. I'm interested in hearing feedback from
users whether this works or not on various platforms.

=head3 Image::PNG::Rewriter

L<Image::PNG::Rewriter> is a utility for unpacking and recompressing
the IDAT (image data) part of a PNG image.

=head3 Image::Pngslimmer

L<Image::Pngslimmer> reduces the size of dynamically created PNG images.
