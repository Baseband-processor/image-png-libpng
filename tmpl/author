=head1 FOR PROGRAMMERS

(This section is only for people who want to fix a bug or add an
improvement to this module, and who want to share the change with
other people by adding it to the public version of this module.)

If you want to alter this module, please note very carefully that the
distributed files are not actually the source code of the module. If
you wish to obtain the source code of [% config.base %], please access
[% config.repository %] using the "git" source control system.

The original files of this distribution make very heavy use of the
L<Template> Perl module in order to cut down the amount of repetitive
stuff which needs to be put into various source and documentation
files. If you plan to alter the C file, you also need a program called
"cfunctions" which you can download from sourceforge.
